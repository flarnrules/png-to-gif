# png-to-gif
A simple set of python scripts to convert sequentially numbered PNGs to GIFs.

## Dependencies

For now, a user will need to use developer tools to utilize this program.
*in the future, I hope to package this up into an application that can be run on most operating systems*

**You will need the following:**
- Python 3 installed on your system
- The PIL external library
- Probably some other stuff
